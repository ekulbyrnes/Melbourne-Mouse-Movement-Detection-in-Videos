# Overview
Mouse models assist in obtaining insights into epileptic disorders caused by genetic mutations. Mice with specific mutations are bred and monitored 24/7 through video.

Going through these videos is a tedious process, when there are long periods where mice are inactive. Therefore, we need to extract periods of activity, in order to increase the efficiency of our analysis pipeline.

# Technical details
Part 1:
* Identify periods of the video where mice are active (ex: walking, eating, drinking)

Part2:

* Develop an app (web or offline) which allows a user to quickly skip the video to identified periods
* Allow users to mark time periods where mce are having seizures using the GUI

# Data Available
* 3 video clips of varying time lengths which monitors 2 mice simultaneously
